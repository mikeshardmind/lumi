# Why not x?


### Why not just use other languages?

- the existing wealth of python libraries
- the familiarity with python is a huge plus for those working with others
  who do not pick up other languages quickly

### What about transpiling?

The closest language I've seen do something "good" here is F#, with Fable
At the point where Fable looks like a good option, I'd rather write F#

### what about other supersets of python?

Mojo looks promising here, but for now, it isn't open source or
production ready. Mojo *could* make this obsolete before it gets off the ground.
